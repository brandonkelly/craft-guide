Guide content is styled using many of Craft CP’s default CSS, but many of the colors and elements unique to Guide can be overridden using the Rebrand section of the Guide settings page. Here you’ll find fields that let you override specific colors and layout styles.

These fields are converted to [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) and are loaded on all pages of the Craft CP.

The Rebrand section includes a text area that can be used to add your own custom CSS. To make sure the CSS doesn’t affect other parts of the CMS, be sure to start all selectors with `.guide_content`.

```css
/* Override Guide CSS with specific selectors */
.guide_content h1 {
  font-weight: 300;
}
```

All CSS custom properties generated by the fields in the Rebrand section are applied to a `.guide_styles` selector. So if you need to manually set a property, your custom css might look something like this:

```css
/* Override CSS Custom Properties */
.guide_styles {
  --grid-gap: 30px;
}
```
