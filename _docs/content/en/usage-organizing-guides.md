![Guide Organizer](https://assets.wbrowar.com/guide/img/guide-organizer.png)

When a guide is first created, it will appear in the "Unused Guides" section of the Organizer. To the right of that column you’ll see columns for the Guide CP, Edit Pages and the Dashboard. Use drag and drop to move a guide to one of these locations.

When hovering over a guide in the Organizer, you'll see a gear appear to the right. Click on that to access quick actions for the guide:

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| View | Preview the guide on a guide page as it would appear in the Guide CP. |
| Edit | Edit brings you to the guide edit page for that guide. Clicking save will return you back to the Organizer |
| Clone | Creates a copy of the guide. |
| Delete | Brings you to a delete confirmation page. Clicking the `Delete` button on this page will completely remove the guide from the CMS. |

### Guide CP Section

Guides dragged into the Guide CP area of the Organizer will appear in the Guide CP Section’s Guide tab. When a user clicks on the Guide CP section, it will bring them to the first guide in the list. The order of the guides in the Organizer determines the order of the guides in the sidebar navigation.

When viewing a guide in the CP section, all of the header tags (`h1, h2, h3, etc...`) will be used to generate a subnav in the sidebar of the page. Clicking on a subnav item will scroll the guide content down to that header.

### Content Edit Pages

Different guides can be displayed on any of the site’s entry sections or category groups. Using the Organizer to drag a guide onto a section area will add a guide menu to the sidebar on that section’s entry edit pages.

When a user is editing an entry in that section, they can click on a guide in the menu to pop up the guide in a modal. This allows the user to view the guide without leaving the edit page.

*NOTE: More than one guide can be added to each edit page.*

### Dashboard Widgets

Dragging a guide to the Dashboard area of the Organizer allows that guide to be added to a Guide widget. From there, a user can add a Guide widget to their dashboard and select this guide from the list of all guides in the Dashboard area.
