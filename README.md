# Guide 2 for Craft CMS 3

Craft CMS is intuitive. Marketing plans and organizational workflows—not so much. Guide lets you create a user manual within Craft CMS so clients don‘t need to go far to get the answers they need.

Guide is made up of two parts:
- [The commercial plugin for Craft 3](https://plugins.craftcms.com/guide)
- [The open source user guide template](https://github.com/wbrowar/craft-guide-templates)

*Note: The license fee for the PRO edition this plugin is $49 via the [Craft Plugin Store](https://plugins.craftcms.com/guide). A LITE edition is offered for free.*
